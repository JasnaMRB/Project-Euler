# Project-Euler
My solutions to Project Euler, written in Java, Python, and hopefully Ruby.
##These files are self-contained
I think it's obvious but anyway, do not consider these files as part of one application project. Each separate file just has one solution to a fun math problem.
###Statistics
I started this repository a long while after I solved 10 problems already, so those first 10 are missing. Though, maybe one day I will go back and add them.
